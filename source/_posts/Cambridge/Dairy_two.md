### Q

I'm a **rising sophomore from China, majoring in Automation with an aspiration to become an entrepreneur.** I'm currently on an academic visit here in Cambridge, and I've just completed my first week. To be honest, things are starting to feel a bit underwhelming and boring.

My main frustration stems from the program structure. We have an English class called 'Academic Lecture' every day, which consumes our mornings and afternoons. While I appreciate the effort, I find the content to be quite basic and not particularly challenging or relevant to my academic goals. It feels more like a generic language course than an academic deep dive.

In the evenings, after dinner, it's frustrating to find that most bookstores and libraries are already closed.

**My original expectation for this visit was to truly connect with local students or people**, but I've been completely wrong on that front. For one, my limited free time is mostly in the evenings, when our teachers advise caution due to safety concerns. Secondly, there seem to be very few students around, and I honestly have no idea how to go about building connections with anyone here. The only people we really interact with are our program managers, assistants, and teachers.

**I came here hoping for a rich cultural immersion and a chance to truly experience British life, beyond just sightseeing.** Right now, it feels much more like a tour than a genuine academic/cultural exchange.

Has anyone been on a similar academic program in the UK or Cambridge? How did you manage to break out of the 'tourist bubble' and connect more deeply? Any advice on how to maximize the remaining time here, especially for cultural engagement and networking with locals/students?

### English Class

8.7 给我们上雅思写作，上课模式也是一道道例题地讲过去，与国内老师相比，国内老师反而多了一步归纳总结写作技巧、整理提供写作语料等系列过程。
