论文讲述了人工智能所遇到的结构性（而非技术性）壁垒。

> This paper formally defines where current AGI hits a structural wall — not a technical one.
>
> It shows that no amount of scaling, reinforcement learning, or recursive optimization will break through three deep epistemological and formal constraints:
>
> \1. Semantic Closure — An AI system cannot generate outputs that require meaning beyond its internal frame.
>
> \2. Non-Computability of Frame Innovation — New cognitive structures cannot be computed from within an existing one.
>
> \3. Statistical Breakdown in Open Worlds — Probabilistic inference collapses in environments with heavy-tailed uncertainty.
>
> These aren’t limitations of today’s models. They’re structural boundaries inherent to algorithmic cognition itself — mathematical, logical, epistemological.
>
> But this isn’t a rejection of AI. It’s a clear definition of the boundary condition that must be faced — and, potentially, designed around.
>
> If AGI fails at this wall, the opportunity isn’t over — it’s just starting. For anyone serious about cognition, this is the real frontier.
