# Introduction to WorldQuant BRAIN

## What is BRAIN?

**Anytime Anywhere**

Use web-based simulator created by WorldQuant that anyone can access anytime by simply registering online.

**Build alphas**

Employ our large collection of data fields and operators to create alphas.

> Alphas are mathematical models that seek to predict the futureprice movements of various financial instruments.

**Backtest alphas**

Run simulations using historical data, andgenerate a summary of past performanceof your model to measure its effectiveness.

### “Simulate“ - Navigation Bar

——where you write out your financial model

You can click the Simulate button to make your first simple attempt.

- Chart：Then, on the right side, there is **a profit and loss chart**. It shows what what could have happened If I consistently applied the model on the left to buy and sell stocks over this time period. This what we called backtest.
- Summary：A bunch of statistics that give you objective criteria that tell you how good the back test is.

## Developing Quantitative Ideas with BRAIN

One method of developing quant ideas：

1. Collect data and information：BRAIN has one of the world's largest collection of data fields relevant to building alphas on stocks.
2. Come up with an idea or hypothesis：The BRAIN Research Consultant program
3. Translate idea into mathematical model：⬆️
4. Backtest the idea on historical data：BRAIN has historical stock data that allows you to simulate past performance with a click of a button.
5. Check for robustness：BRAIN also generates multiple objective parameters to evaluate backtests such as Sharpe.

## The BRAIN Research Consultant Program

**What Research Consultants do**

- Build alphas using tools and data on the BRAIN platform
- Submit alphas to WorldQuant if they meet thresholds
- Eam merit-based financial compensation in a part-time, flexible, remote setu

**Key requirements**

- At least 18 years old
- Resident of select countries
- Analytically oriented, comfortable with data

**What is not required**

- Prior financial knowledge
- Coding experience

## Why become a Research Consultant

### Earn

- Opportunity to earn based on the quality and quantity of your ideas.
  - **\$120** per day； $25,000 per quarter
- Freedom to **work remotely** at your own pace in an authorized location.

### Learn

- In-depth **training and mentorship** from experienced quants.
- **Hands-on** learning

### Connect

- Potential opportunities for **internships and full-time positions** with WorldQuant
- A **community** that fosters collaboration, competition and opportunity

## How to Become a Research Consultant

From **User** to **Consultant**

- User needs to score **10,000 points** in the **WorldQuant Challenge** to become eligible to be a consultant
- **Points** can be earned by **submitting alphas** that meet our **thresholds**

- **Rule of thumb:** You can earn 10,000 points by submitting 5 to 10 alphas
  on 5 or more distinct days
  - You earn points every day you submit alphas
  - Maximum points that can be earned in a single day: 2,000
  - Usually, these points can be earned by submitting 1 to 2 alphas in a day

# What is an Alpha?

The aim of Alpha:

- Determine how to distribute **capital** among a group of **financial instruments**.

To ensure downsides protection:

- Develop **equity long-short market neutral alphas**
- Expected to produce substantially better risk-adjusted returns

Taking a "Long Position" in a stock:

- Buying the stock
- If the stock **increase** in value, you will **profit**

Taking a "Short Position" in a stock:

- **Borrowing** a stock (usually from a **broker**), selling it, then hoping it declines in value
- Then, **buy it back at a lower price** and return borrowed shares

Equity Long-short Market Neutral Strategy:

- Used commonly by hedge funds
- Equal dollar amount of **long positions** and **short positions**
- This strategy can work even if **long position declines** in value. Because **profit from shorting** can be higher than **losses from long positions**
- **GOAL**: minimize **exposure to market** in general, and **profit from a change** in the spread between two stocks

> - **市场敞口（Market Exposure）**：指投资组合的价值受市场整体变动影响的程度。如果一个投资组合与市场指数（如标普500指数）高度相关，那么它就有较高的市场敞口。
>
> - **最小化市场敞口（Minimize Market Exposure）**：这通常涉及到对冲策略，比如使用衍生品（如期货、期权）来抵消市场风险，或者构建一个与市场指数不同步的投资组合，以减少市场下跌时的损失。
>
> - **对冲基金（Hedge Funds）**：这种策略在对冲基金中尤其常见，它们使用复杂的金融工具和策略来减少市场风险，寻求在各种市场条件下都能获得正回报。
>
> - **风险管理（Risk Management）**：最小化市场敞口是风险管理的一部分，目的是保护投资组合免受不利市场条件的影响。
>
> - **市场中性（Market Neutral）**：最小化市场敞口的目标之一是实现市场中性，即投资组合的表现不受市场整体涨跌的影响，而是依赖于选股或市场时机选择等其他因素。

## HOW TO

Begin by defining what instruments you want to trade.

The **universe** can be a group of US stocks defined on the basis of their liquidity.

An Alpha is a vector of the predicted value of the stocks in the universe. Each value can change each day and has two properties.

1. Sign: positive sign = long, or buy, negative sign = short, or sell
2. Magnitude: it determines **capital distribution** among stocks in the portfolio

Steps to Alpha Creation:

1. Generate an idea
2. Implement the idea
   - expression
   - python code
3. Apply operations on raw alpha vector
4. Analyze statistics
